/**
 * ü•öüêá - Dutch version of Simon Says.
 *
 * <p>'Commando pinkelen' is a concentration-oriented game that can be played by both children and adults. The number of
 * participants is unlimited.
 *
 * <p>In the simplest version, the game leader has four 'commands' at their disposal: the commands 'pinkelen', 'hollow',
 * 'round' and 'flat'. When the game leader gives the 'command pinkelen', the players drum with their index fingers on
 * the edge of the table; for the 'command hollow', the participants place their hand with the back downwards on the
 * table; for the 'command round', the hands are placed with the fingertips on the table; for the 'command flat', the
 * players place their hands flat on the table, with the palms downwards. However, if the game leader omits the word
 * 'command' in their command, the player is expected to ignore the command. Anyone who makes a mistake in this is out
 * and cannot participate any further.
